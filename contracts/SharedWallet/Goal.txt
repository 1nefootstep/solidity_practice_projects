Features:
1. Multiple users can share this wallet.
2. There is an owner that can set allowances
to other users that share the wallet.
3. Users only functionality is withdraw funds.
4. Only owner can deposit funds.

Considerations:
1. Owner should be able to withdraw everything freely.
2. However, if allowance is given to a user, that balance should be reserved
 for that user. I.e., cannot set allowance as 51% for 2 different people.
